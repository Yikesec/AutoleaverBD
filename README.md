# 🚪 AutoLeaveGroups
_The perfect tool for avoiding unwanted social interactions in Discord, because let's face it, group chats can be scary... (〃￣ω￣〃ゞ_

## 📖 About
AutoLeaveGroups is a BetterDiscord plugin designed for those of us who find solace in solitude. If the idea of getting pinged in a group chat fills you with dread, or if you just prefer the sound of silence, this plugin is for you. It's okay, we understand... socializing is hard. （＞ｙ＜）

## ⭐ Features
- **Automatic Group Chat Escape:** Leave Discord group chats as soon as you're added. It's like having an invisibility cloak! (ง •̀_•́)ง
- **Whitelist Magic:** Keep some group chats around, you know, for those rare times when people are... tolerable. (･ω<)☆

## 🛠 Installation
1. **Get BetterDiscord:** First, install BetterDiscord. You'll need it for this to work, not that I'm telling you what to do... (ー_ー;)
2. **Download AutoLeaveGroups:** Click on that shiny download button somewhere on this page. It's the only friend you'll need.
3. **Place the Plugin:** Drag and drop the AutoLeaveGroups file into your BetterDiscord plugins folder. It's like dropping a letter into the ocean...
4. **Enable in Discord:** Finally, enable the plugin in the BetterDiscord settings. That's it, you're ready to be alone again! (ノωヽ)

## 📚 Usage
- **Turning it On/Off:** Just toggle it in the plugin settings. Easy, right? Not everything has to be complicated.
- **Whitelist Groups:** Modify the `whitelist` array in the script. Add the group IDs of the chats you don't hate. I'm sure there's one or two... maybe.
